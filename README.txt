Hello,

This is a collection of weekly tasks from second-year university, centered around the fundamentals of C++, which I have completed.

These were set to aid me in our final coursework submission, building a command-line scientific matrix calculator.

To view this project, please visit the pinned repository "Vermaaaaaa/CLI-Project," which I am collaborating on.
